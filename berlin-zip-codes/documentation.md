# Berlin's ZIP codes Documentation

## Motivation
The lack of an official (and unofficial) database that groups ZIP codes by boroughs and neighborhoods has motivated me to search for this information and develop a database.

## ....
To develop the database,many different internet sources have been consulted and the results have been controlled by analyzing each zip code individually.
